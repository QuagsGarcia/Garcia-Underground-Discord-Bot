This script is connected to my discord server with a discord bot and I can access the bots functions through its token.

The bot has a certain set of functions. One of those functions includes a role update. The script connects the discord bot to my server with a batch file. Once the bot detects the role change, it sends a variety of information to my server.

There is a catch function that gets the information and matches to see if the person is in the server.

Once the person is found, a role update function in the server is triggered and this is essential for all of my role scripts.

The javascript is triggered through the server with a javascript package called axios.
